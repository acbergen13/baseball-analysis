🏆 MLB MVP Predictor (2004–2024)
📘 Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict Major League Baseball (MLB) MVP winners based on player performance statistics from 2004 to 2024.

By combining batting and pitching data with MVP historical results, the model learns the statistical profile of MVP-caliber players and estimates the probability that any player in a given season could win the MVP award.

We use PyTorch to build and train a neural network that outputs an MVP probability score for each player.
